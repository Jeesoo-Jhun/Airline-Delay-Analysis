# ✈️ Airline Delay Analysis

This project analyzes the main causes of flight delays using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and inferential statistics.

## 📁 Data Sources
- `flights.csv`
- `airports.csv`
- `airlines.csv`

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify key factors contributing to flight delays.
- Address specific questions for three key stakeholder groups.
- Present insights using clear and intuitive visualizations.

## 👥 Stakeholders & Questions
1. **Passengers**
   - What are the top causes of delays?
   - Are certain airports more prone to delays?
   - Is delay likelihood higher on certain dates?

2. **Airlines**
   - Which airline has the highest average delay?
   - Are some routes more delayed than others?
   - How do weather-related delays compare?

3. **Airport Authorities**
   - What time of day sees the most delays?
   - Does airport size correlate with delay rates?
   - Are delays clustered around specific holidays or seasons?

## 🧹 Preprocessing
- Removed irrelevant or incomplete columns.
- Merged datasets by airport and airline codes.
- Engineered new features for improved insights.

## 📊 Key Findings
- Weather and air traffic are among the leading causes of delays.
- Some airports and airlines consistently show higher delay percentages.
- Delays spike during holidays and certain peak hours.

## 📌 Note
All code and visualizations are in the provided Jupyter notebook.
